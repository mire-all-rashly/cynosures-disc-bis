# Topic
Jira server-side template injection
(i.e., cve-2019-11581).

## Technologies covered
- [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
  - [cve-2019-11581](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-security-advisory-2019-07-10-973486595.html)
- Postfix for SMTP server, but any will do

## Runtime Information
Generally, this assumes from the source directory unless otherwise stated.  You
need to generate a [trial key](https://my.atlassian.com/license/evaluation) for
JIRA Core before full install automation is possible.  This means you will need
to manually run through installation at least once up to key generation to
populate the [mechanize-jira.py](jira-server/data/mechanize-jira.py) script for
full automation.

### Dependencies
You may be able to get by with less, but ideally:
- make
- docker
- tmux

### Running
```
make && make run
```

This demonstrations requires a bit of timing as services need to be configured
on the fly before they are exploitable.  For reference, the layout is along the
lines of:

| jira-server | mechanize |
|-------------|-----------|
| exploit cli | listener  |

That is, the top right pane will run through configuration of the Jira server
(top left) and when it is done you can run `python exploit.py` in the bottom
left pane to exploit the server.  This will throw a simple reverse shell to the
bottom right pane.

### Cleanup
```
make clean
```
